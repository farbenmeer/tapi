This library makes it possible to build a Rest API including a fully typed client without a compile step.


## State of this library
Very much alpha. I just came up with this idea.

## Plans
* Add automatic Caching based on cache tags

## Inspiration
Very much [TRPC](https://trpc.io/). It's quite similar but with a REST paradigm so the API is actually usable for other clients.
